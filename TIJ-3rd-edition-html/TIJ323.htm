<p><b>WARNING: BEFORE OPENING THE DISC PACKAGE, CAREFULLY READ THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE LICENSE AGREEMENT &amp; WARANTEE LIMITATION ON THE PREVIOUS PAGES.</b><br></p>
<p>The CD ROM packaged with this book is a multimedia seminar consisting of synchronized slides and audio lectures. The goal of this seminar is to introduce you to the fundamentals necessary for you to move on to Java. The CD also contains a link to the source code for this book, a link to the HTML version of this book, and the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> editions of this book in HTML form.<br></p>
<p>This CD ROM will work with most computers that have a sound system, including Windows, Linux, and Mac OS/9 and OS/10. However, you must: <br></p>
<ol>
<li>Install a web browser on your machine, if you don&#146;t already have one.
Tested browsers include Mozilla (<i>www.Mozilla.org</i>) and the most recent
version of Microsoft&#146;s Internet Explorer.</li>
<li>Install an MP3 sound player on your machine. The slides are designed to work
either with the free RealPlayer from <i>www.Real.com</i> or with another MP3
player (newer machines come with MP3 players pre-installed).</li>
<li>At this point you should be able to play the lectures on the CD. Using the
the most recent version of Internet Explorer or the Mozilla Web browser, open
the file <b>Install.html</b> that you&#146;ll find on the CD. This will
introduce you to the CD and provide further instructions about the use of the
CD. Note that on Windows machines and some Linux machines, the CD should
auto-run when you insert it in your CD
player.</li></ol><!-- <hr><b>Placeholder</b> -->
